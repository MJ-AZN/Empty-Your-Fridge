## DESCRIPTION

Empty Your Fridge is a web application that prompts the user to enter ingredients the wish to utilize in a recipe. Upon receiving the user's inputs, EYF will cross-compare their ingredient entries to a database, and return recipes to the user that match their parameters. Upon clicking any of these recipes, the user will be taken to a separate page containing the cooking instructions and nutritional data on the ingredients used.

## CREDITS

Empty Your Fridge was written by MJ, Chan Nguyen, Brian Lee, and Kyle Oros. It utilizes the MealDB API in regards to the recipes and their respective profiles, and the Spoonacular Nutritional Data API to calculate the nutritional data on the ingredients found in MealDB.
